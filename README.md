# Titanic Classification Pipeline with Spark
This notebook demonstrates how to build a complete classification pipeline using Apache Spark and the Titanic dataset. 
The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The goal is to predict survival 
("Survived") based on passenger features such as age, sex, and cabin class.
